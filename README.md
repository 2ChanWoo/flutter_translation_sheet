## translator cli [trcli]

Command line application to make your l10n super fast.
Compose your strings in yaml/json format and use GoogleSheet for auto translate.

### Install:

> You need to have `flutter` or `dart` SDK in your System PATH.

#### Github install:

```bash
flutter pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/roipeker/trcli.git
```

Just run `trcli` in any folder to create a template config.


#### Local install:
clone the repo in your computer and replace <path> accordingly:
```bash
flutter pub global activate --source path <path>
```

### Usage:

Go with your terminal in any folder (or Flutter project folder), and run `trcli`.
First time will create a template for you, and you will have to get your [Google credentials json](https://medium.com/@a.marenkov/how-to-get-credentials-for-google-sheets-456b7e88c430)
Follow the comments in `tfconfig.yaml` and fill the `gsheet:` section, and change the output folder as needed.

Take the sample data input as reference, and use it in your own project.

**trcli** will try to keep the local input and the remote sheet in sync, and automatically generate the locales for you every time you run it.

After a while of not using it, Google Sheet performance slow down on every request, so it might take a little longer to get the output generated.
Once it warms up (run 1 time) the sync performance is pretty solid.


### Considerations:

- In your spreadsheet, the first column will always be your "keys", don't change that, don't move the column.

- In your `trconfig.yaml`, the first locale you define is your **master** language:

```yaml
locales:
  - es ## master language used in `entry_file`
  - en ## language list to translate.
  - ko
```

- The tool only analyzes the locales in your config... will not keep updated any other sheet column with other locales.

- You can move the columns, or add new columns, around as long as the `keys` is always the first (*A1*).

- The 1st ROW in your sheet are the "headers", don't change the autogenerated names.

- If *trcli* finds the 2nd ROW empty in any column, it will take the data corrupted, and will re-upload for translation.

- If the row count from keys is different from the master language, it will invalidate the entire sheet.
