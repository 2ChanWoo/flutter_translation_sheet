### üß∞ Install:

> You need to have `flutter` or `dart` SDK in your System PATH.

```bash
flutter pub global activate flutter_translation_sheet
```

Now just run `fts` in any folder to create a template configuration file.

Check `--help` on any sub-command of `fts`:
- `fts run`
- `fts fetch`
- `fts extract`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage:

Go with your terminal in any folder (or Flutter project folder), and run `fts run`.

First time will create a template for you, and you will have to get your [Google credentials json](https://medium.com/@a.marenkov/how-to-get-credentials-for-google-sheets-456b7e88c430).

Once you get the json, go to `tfconfig.yaml` and in the `gsheet:` there are two ways to fill the credentials (you only need to use one):

1. Add `credentials_path:` followed by the path of your json. You can copy the json file to the root folder of your project. The path can be absolute or relative.

Example:
```yaml
gsheets:
  credentials_path: c:/my_project/credentials.json or ./credentials.json
```
#### ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: paths should be either in the form "C:\\\Users\\\etc", with two backslash characters, or using forwardslash characters instead such as "C:/Users/etc". 

2. Add `credentials:` followed by the whole credentials json content

Example:
```yaml
gsheets:
  credentials: {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "project-id",
    "private_key_id": "",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvAIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCB-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "gsheets@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "123456",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gsheets%40evolution-cp-calculator.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  }
```

You can find more information in the comments in `tfconfig.yaml` and fill the `gsheet:` section, and change the output folder as needed.

Once you have your configuration file ready, run `fts` to generate your sample google sheets.

Take the sample data input as reference, and use it in your own project.

**fts** will try to keep the local input and the remote sheet in sync, and automatically generate the locales for you every time you run it.

After a while of not using it, Google Sheet performance slow down on every request, so it might take a little longer to get the output generated.
Once it warms up (run 1 time) the sync performance is pretty solid.


```bash
fts fetch
```

Unlike `fts run`, `fetch` doesn't sync, nor validates the data structure.

Uses the local strings as entry map, downloads the latest data from GoogleSheet and generates the files accordingly.
Is a much faster process. Very useful when you made manual corrections in your sheets for the auto-translated locales.

Do not manually modify the *master language* column on your Google Sheet, change the data in the string source file
and let `fts` do the upload.

If there are differences of master lang strings between local and remote, the entire row will be cleared and regenerated with auto translation
using the latest strings, and manual changes will get lost.

Currently you have to be careful, and keep your manual translations backed up just in case you modify the master language string.

### Variables:

To store "variables" or placeholders in your strings to be replaced later in your code, use the follow notation:

```
"Welcome back {{user}}, today is {{date}}."
```

It will store the values in the sheet as {{0}} {{1}} and so on, to avoid complications with GoogleTranslate, and it will
generate a *vars.lock* file in the directory where you point your "entry_file" in config.

So you can define your own pattern for the code/json generation:

```yaml
## pattern to applies final variables in the generated json/dart Strings.
## Enclose * in the pattern you need.
## {*} = {{name}} becomes {name}
## %* = {{name}} becomes %name
## (*) = {{name}} becomes (name)
## - Special case when you need * as prefix or suffix, use *? as splitter
## ***?** = {{name}} becomes **name**
param_output_pattern: "{{*}}"
```
Warning: Do not confuse the data source placeholder format with `param_output_pattern` configuration.
Data-source (your yaml strings) must have this form `{{variable}}` to be interpreted as variables.
The generated output strings uses `param_output_pattern` configuration to render the variables as you please.

### Utilities:

- `fts extract [--path] [--output]`: This tiny utility command performs a shallow search (no syslinks) of your dart classes and uses a basic pattern matching to capture your code's Strings.
Might come in handy when you wanna localize an app with hardcoded texts. It only process '.dart' files, and the String matching isn't very permissive (single words Strings are skipped).
Pass the folder to analyse in `--path` and the folder (or json file) path to save in `--output`.
It will output a single json file cloning the structure of the source code folder tree for easy manual search.
It's up to you to clean it up, adjust keys, split it up in other data source files, and USE it with "Flutter Translate Sheet".
This command tool is in alpha state, but don't worry, as it doesn't touch any of analyzed files, so is safe.
   

### üìù Considerations:

- In your spreadsheet, the first column will always be your "keys", don't change that, don't move the column.

- In your `trconfig.yaml`, the first locale you define is your **master** language:

```yaml
locales:
  - es ## master language used in `entry_file`
  - en ## language list to translate.
  - ko
```

- The tool only analyzes the locales in your config... will not keep updated any other sheet column with other locales.

- You can move the columns, or add new columns, around as long as the `keys` is always the first (*A1*).

- The 1st ROW in your sheet are the "headers", don't change the autogenerated names.

- If *fts* finds the 2nd ROW empty in any column, it will take the data corrupted, and will re-upload for translation.

- If the row count from keys is different from the master language, it will invalidate the entire sheet.
