## translator cli [trcli]

Command line application to make your l10n super fast.
Compose your strings in yaml/json format and use GoogleSheet for auto translate.

### Install:

> You need to have `flutter` or `dart` SDK in your System PATH.

#### Github install:

```bash
flutter pub global activate -sgit https://github.com/roipeker/trcli.git
```

Just run `trcli` in any folder to create a template config.

#### Local install:
clone the repo in your computer and replace <path> accordingly:
```bash
flutter pub global activate --source path <path>
```

### Usage:

Go with your terminal in any folder (or Flutter project folder), and run `trcli run`.

First time will create a template for you, and you will have to get your [Google credentials json](https://medium.com/@a.marenkov/how-to-get-credentials-for-google-sheets-456b7e88c430)
Follow the comments in `tfconfig.yaml` and fill the `gsheet:` section, and change the output folder as needed.

Take the sample data input as reference, and use it in your own project.

**trcli** will try to keep the local input and the remote sheet in sync, and automatically generate the locales for you every time you run it.

After a while of not using it, Google Sheet performance slow down on every request, so it might take a little longer to get the output generated.
Once it warms up (run 1 time) the sync performance is pretty solid.


```bash
trcli fetch
```

Unlike `trcli run`, `fetch` doesn't sync, nor validates the data structure.

Uses the local strings as entry map, downloads the latest data from GoogleSheet and generates the files accordingly.
Is a much faster process. Very useful when you made manual corrections in your sheets for the auto-translated locales.

Do not manually modify the *master language* column on your Google Sheet, change the data in the string source file
and let `trcli` do the upload.

If there are differences of master lang strings between local and remote, the entire row will be cleared and regenerated with auto translation
using the latest strings, and manual changes will get lost.

Currently you have to be careful, and keep your manual translations backed up just in case you modify the master language string.


### Considerations:

- In your spreadsheet, the first column will always be your "keys", don't change that, don't move the column.

- In your `trconfig.yaml`, the first locale you define is your **master** language:

```yaml
locales:
  - es ## master language used in `entry_file`
  - en ## language list to translate.
  - ko
```

- The tool only analyzes the locales in your config... will not keep updated any other sheet column with other locales.

- You can move the columns, or add new columns, around as long as the `keys` is always the first (*A1*).

- The 1st ROW in your sheet are the "headers", don't change the autogenerated names.

- If *trcli* finds the 2nd ROW empty in any column, it will take the data corrupted, and will re-upload for translation.

- If the row count from keys is different from the master language, it will invalidate the entire sheet.
